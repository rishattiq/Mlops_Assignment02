# Mlops_Assignment02
A fully functional Airflow DAG script

# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to automate the processes of data extraction, transformation, and version-controlled storage using Apache Airflow, DVC (Data Version Control), and Google Drive. The project focuses on extracting data from dawn.com and bbc.com, performing basic transformation tasks, and storing the processed data on Google Drive while ensuring version control using DVC.

# Usage: 
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set up Airflow and DVC as per the instructions provided in the documentation.
Customize the data extraction, transformation, and loading logic in the Python script (main.py) as per your requirements.
Run the Airflow DAG to automate the data processing tasks.
Monitor the workflow execution and track versioned data using Airflow and DVC.
